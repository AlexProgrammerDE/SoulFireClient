# SoulFireClient

This is a frontend for the [SoulFire server](https://github.com/AlexProgrammerDE/SoulFire).
It mainly targets the web, but uses native APIs using Tauri.

> [!NOTE]
> For more info about SoulFire, take a look at the main [SoulFire repository](https://github.com/AlexProgrammerDE/SoulFire).

## About the client

Built using latest web tech to consistently work on both web, desktop and mobile.
The client is the GUI for the SoulFire server, but it uses the official SoulFire gRPC API.
Anything that can be done using the SF client can also be done using gRPC HTTP API calls directly.
