/**
 * Service for authenticating users via email-based passwordless login.
 *
 * Authentication Flow:
 * 1. Client calls Login with the user's email address
 * 2. If the email is registered, a six-digit code is sent to that email
 * 3. Client receives an auth_flow_token and EmailCode response
 * 4. User enters the code from their email
 * 5. Client calls EmailCode with the auth_flow_token and the code
 * 6. If valid, client receives a JWT token; if invalid, receives a Failure
 *
 * Security Features:
 * - Rate limited to 20 requests per 10 minutes per origin to prevent brute force attacks
 * - Auth flow tokens expire after 15 minutes
 * - Same response for registered and unregistered emails to prevent email enumeration
 * - Invalid codes return the same error as expired/invalid flow tokens to prevent timing attacks
 *
 * Error Handling:
 * - RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED: Rate limit exceeded (too many login attempts)
 * - UNAUTHENTICATED: No origin header provided (required for rate limiting)
 * - INTERNAL: Unexpected server error during processing
 *
 * @generated from protobuf service soulfire.v1.LoginService
